# 🧪 Proxmox Networking & Security Lab
**Enterprise Simulation: VLAN Segmentation | DNS Configuration | Firewall Rules**

A virtual home lab simulating enterprise networks using Proxmox, pfSense, Windows & Linux systems.  
Key concepts demonstrated include VLAN segmentation, DNS redirection via Pi-hole, and access control using pfSense firewall rules.

## 📷 Optional Enhancements

- Add **screenshots** of:
  - pfSense VLAN and rule config
  - Pi-hole admin panel with blocked queries
  - Security Onion alerts dashboard
  - Kali attacks and packet captures
- Create a **network diagram** with draw.io or Lucidchart and include it

## 🔐 VLAN Segmentation & Firewall Rules

- pfSense is configured as a VLAN trunk to manage traffic across VLAN 10 (Client), VLAN 20 (Server), and VLAN 30 (Security)
- Inter-VLAN communication is controlled via **stateful firewall rules**, ensuring least privilege
- Example Rule: Only allow RDP from VLAN 10 to Windows Server on VLAN 20; deny all other traffic by default
- VLANs are assigned based on VM role, with unique IP ranges and DHCP scopes

## 🌐 DNS Filtering with Pi-hole
- Pi-hole deployed in the Server VLAN (192.168.20.2) as the default DNS resolver
- DNS traffic from all VLANs is redirected to Pi-hole using pfSense NAT port redirection
- Logs and dashboards show DNS query sources and blocked domains
- Custom blocklists and whitelists configured for fine-grained DNS control
