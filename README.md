# 🧪 Proxmox Networking & Security Lab
**Enterprise Simulation: VLAN Segmentation | DNS Configuration | Firewall Rules**

![Proxmox Logo](./images/proxmox-logo.png)  

A virtual home lab designed to simulate an enterprise network environment using:
> **Proxmox VE**, **pfSense**, **Windows Server 2019**, **Windows 10**, **Security Onion**, **Kali Linux**, **Debian Admin**, **Pi-hole**, and **Metasploitable2**

---

This lab demonstrates:

- 🔐 VLAN segmentation and inter-VLAN firewall rules
- 🌐 DNS redirection and filtering with Pi-hole
- 🧰 IDS-ready architecture using Security Onion
- ⚙️ Multi-VM configuration for security monitoring and testing environments

## 🧱 Lab Topology Overview

- **Proxmox VE** with `vmbr0` (WAN) and `vmbr1` (LAN)
- **pfSense** as router/firewall using VLAN trunking
- **Pi-hole** for DNS filtering and ad blocking
- Simulated VLANs for Clients, Servers, and Security Zones
- Multiple VMs representing real-world roles in a segmented network

## 📷 Optional Enhancements

- Add **screenshots** of:
  - pfSense DHCP leases VLAN and rule config
  - Pi-hole admin panel with blocked queries
  - Security Onion alerts dashboard
  - Kali attacks and packet captures
- Create a **network diagram** with draw.io or Lucidchart and include it

---

## 🔐 VLAN Segmentation & Firewall Rules

- pfSense is configured as a VLAN trunk to manage traffic across VLAN 10 (Client), VLAN 20 (Server), and VLAN 30 (Security)
- Inter-VLAN communication is controlled via **stateful firewall rules**, ensuring least privilege
- Example Rule: Only allow RDP from VLAN 10 to Windows Server on VLAN 20; deny all other traffic by default
- VLANs are assigned based on VM role, with unique IP ranges and DHCP scopes

## 🌐 DNS Filtering with Pi-hole
- Pi-hole deployed in the Server VLAN (192.168.20.2) as the default DNS resolver
- DNS traffic from all VLANs is redirected to Pi-hole using pfSense NAT port redirection
- Logs and dashboards show DNS query sources and blocked domains
- Custom blocklists and whitelists configured for fine-grained DNS control
