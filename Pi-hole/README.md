# Step 6: 🧩 Pi-hole DNS Server Configuration (VLAN 20)

This guide documents how to fix and configure the Pi-hole container/VM to serve as the DNS server for **VLAN 20** and other VLANs in the Proxmox lab.

## 📌 Problem

Pi-hole VM was originally assigned the wrong IP address: `192.168.1.2` (outside target VLAN).  
We wanted Pi-hole to use `192.168.20.2` to serve as the DNS server for All the VLANs but targeted for VLAN 20 — the same subnet as the Windows client and Debian admin VM.

## 🔍 Initial Troubleshooting

- Ran `ip a` on the Pi-hole console.
- Verified the interface in use was `eth0`.
- Saw the current IP was incorrect (`192.168.1.2`).

## 🧪 Temporary IP Fix (Manual Command-Line Change)

Manually changed IP address (not via /etc/network or Netplan, but directly):

- **sudo dhcpcd eth0**
- **sudo ip addr add 192.168.20.2/24 dev eth0**
- **sudo ip route add default via 192.168.20.1**

### 💾 Make IP Assignment Permanent

To make the Pi-hole IP assignment persistent after reboot, manually edit the network interface configuration file:

### 📝 Edit the interfaces file:

- **sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces**
> 📝 Note: This guide assumes you're using a Debian-based system where `/etc/network/interfaces` is used instead of Netplan.

### ✏️ Add the following configuration:

```ini
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
  address 192.168.20.2
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  gateway 192.168.20.1
```

- **Confirm change with 'ip a'**

### ✅ Confirm Connectivity to Pi-hole Dashboard  

Access the Pi-hole Dashboard from the Debian Admin Machine (VLAN10) using the Pi-hole IP: `192.168.20.2`

### 🔄 Ensure Pi-hole Can Answer Redirected Traffic and Set Upstream DNS Servers 

To allow Pi-hole to properly resolve redirected DNS queries (those not originally intended for Pi-hole), follow these steps:

1. Open the Pi-hole Admin Dashboard.
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **DNS**.
3. Under **Interface listening behavior**, select:  
   > **Listen on all interfaces, permit all origins**
   > This setting ensures Pi-hole accepts DNS queries coming from clients in **other VLANs**, not just from its own subnet.
4. Under **Upstream DNS Servers**, ensure the following is selected:  
   - **Google (IPv4) (ECS, DNSSEC)**

This setup allows Pi-hole to accept DNS queries redirected from other servers (e.g., `8.8.8.8`, `1.1.1.1`) and forward queries securely to Google DNS with ECS and DNSSEC enabled.

## Pi-hole Query Log Demonstration

The following screenshots show DNS query logs captured by Pi-hole from various devices across VLANs, confirming proper DNS resolution and traffic monitoring.

- 🪟 192.168.10.100 – Windows 10 Client (VLAN 10)
- 🐧 192.168.10.101 – Debian Admin Machine (VLAN 10)
- 🧪 192.168.30.100 – Kali Linux (VLAN 30)
- 🖥️ 192.168.20.102 – Windows Server 2019 (VLAN 20)

## Pi-hole Dashboard Display

The screenshot below highlights key Pi-hole metrics, including:

- **Total DNS Queries**
- **Queries Blocked**
- **Percentage Blocked**
- **Domains on Blocklists**

These metrics are circled in red for clarity and help demonstrate that DNS filtering is active and functioning as expected.
